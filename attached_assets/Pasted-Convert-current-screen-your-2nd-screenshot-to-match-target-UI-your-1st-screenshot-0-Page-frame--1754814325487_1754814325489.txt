Convert current screen (your 2nd screenshot) to match target UI (your 1st screenshot)
0) Page frame & typography
Constrain the main content to a readable width (~720–760px) with equal left/right padding (~20–24px).

Use a single font across the page. Headings: extra-bold, tight letter-spacing (~-0.02em). Body: regular/medium weight.

Keep the page background light (white or near-white). Remove any unnecessary gradients or glows.

1) Remove unrelated sections from this screen
Remove the entire referral hero block (hero-section) containing the “Invite & Unlock” title, code display, and referral button.

Remove the how-it-works block with the numbered steps.

The first visible element after the sticky header should now be the combined main section (described below).

2) Combine into a single main section
Merge centered-heading-section, card-stack-container, and bottom-status-pill into one HTML section.

This section should have:

Background color: white (matching page background in the target design).

Padding top: ~28px, bottom: ~24px, left/right: ~20–24px.

Elements vertically stacked: heading → subtitle → card stack → status pill.

Equal horizontal alignment so all elements feel like part of the same block.

Remove extra outer margins or dividers between these three elements so they read as one unit.

3) Centered heading area (inside the combined section)
Title: large (~26–28px), bold, center-aligned, max two lines.

Subtitle: ~15–16px, muted grey, center-aligned, single paragraph.

Gap between title and subtitle: ~8px.

Gap between subtitle and card stack: ~12–16px.

4) Card stack (inside the combined section)
Visual

Always display three cards: top (upright), middle (rotated clockwise), back (rotated counter-clockwise).

Container height: ~320–340px, centered horizontally.

Card width: clamp between 280px and 440px (~76vw on small screens). Height: ~210–230px.

Corner radius: 24px (slightly larger than current).

Shadows: soft, wide blur, low opacity—remove harsh or glowing shadows.

Top card

Upright (0° rotation), no blur.

Warm vertical gradient background (light warm → medium warm), slightly desaturated.

Text: left-aligned, white. Title ~22–24px, bold. Body ~14–15px, max 3–5 lines. Internal padding ~20–22px.

Middle card

Rotated clockwise (~+8°), slightly lower vertical offset (~2% down from center), very subtle blur.

Background: soft pastel yellow. Minimal or no readable text.

Back card

Rotated counter-clockwise (~–8°), slightly higher vertical offset (~2% up from center), slightly more blur than middle card.

Background: soft pastel blue. Minimal or no readable text.

Depth

Ensure correct stacking: top > middle > back. Cards should peek clearly from behind the top card.

Animation (GSAP — design intent)

Initial load: fade/scale-in (0.98→1) with small stagger from back → middle → top (50–80ms gap).

Swipe: top card exits horizontally with ~10° tilt and slight upward lift. Middle becomes top (remove blur, reset rotation), back becomes middle (clockwise rotation, slight blur), insert new back card (counter-clockwise rotation, higher offset, slight blur). Maintain 3-card stack at all times.

5) Bottom status pill (inside the combined section)
Single full-width pill with:

Very light pink background, no border, fully rounded (infinite radius).

Height ≥44px, padding: ~12–14px vertical, ~16–18px horizontal.

Inline layout: small heart icon + single line of tip text.

Remove the “View All Cards” button/link entirely—only show the icon and the text.

Text: medium weight, muted grey; icon and text vertically centered.

6) Sticky header/footer adjustments
Keep sticky header minimal (back button + short title). No heavy shadows or large vertical height.

Footer CTA (if kept) should not crowd the main section—maintain clear separation.

7) Color and contrast
Page/body text: near-black for headings, muted grey for secondary text.

Top card gradient: warm tones, desaturated.

Middle card: pastel yellow; back card: pastel blue.

Ensure white text on gradient passes AA contrast.

8) Spacing rhythm
Gap between heading and card stack: 12–16px.

Gap between card stack and pill: 16–24px.

No extra gap between pill and bottom padding of section.

9) Final clean-up checklist
All three parts (heading, cards, pill) are visually unified in one white-background section.

No “View All Cards” link in the pill.

Three cards visible with correct rotations, offsets, and soft shadows.

Top card shows full content; middle/back cards are decorative with soft blur.

Section aligns visually with the target screenshot in structure and spacing.
