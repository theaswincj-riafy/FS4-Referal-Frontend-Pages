Update specific sections to match target UI (do not touch other sections)
Important:

Do NOT remove or alter any unrelated sections.

All other sections in the HTML must work exactly as they do now.

Only the sections shown in the provided screenshot (centered-heading-section, card-stack-container, bottom-status-pill) should have their UI updated.

1) Combine into a single main section
Merge centered-heading-section, card-stack-container, and bottom-status-pill into one HTML section.

This section should:

Have a white background (matching target design).

Use unified padding: top ~28px, bottom ~24px, left/right ~20–24px.

Contain: heading → subtitle → card stack → status pill, stacked vertically.

Align all elements consistently with equal horizontal insets.

Remove any extra gaps/dividers between these three elements so they appear as one block.

2) Centered heading area (inside the combined section)
Title: bold (~26–28px), center-aligned, max two lines.

Subtitle: ~15–16px, muted grey, center-aligned.

Gap between title and subtitle: ~8px.

Gap between subtitle and card stack: ~12–16px.

3) Card stack (inside the combined section)
Structure & sizing

Show three cards at all times:

Top card: upright (0° rotation), no blur, full content visible.

Middle card: rotated clockwise (~+8°), slightly lower, subtle blur, pastel yellow background.

Back card: rotated counter-clockwise (~–8°), slightly higher, slightly more blur, pastel blue background.

Card width: clamp between 280px–440px (~76vw on small screens). Height ~210–230px.

Corner radius: 24px.

Shadows: soft, wide, low-opacity — remove harsh or glowing shadows.

Top card content

Warm vertical gradient background (light warm → medium warm, desaturated).

White, left-aligned text: title (~22–24px, bold) and body (~14–15px, 3–5 lines max).

Internal padding: ~20–22px.

GSAP behavior (design intent)

On load: fade/scale in all three cards with small stagger from back → middle → top.

On swipe: top card exits with tilt (~10°) and lift, middle becomes top, back becomes middle, insert a new back card (maintaining three visible cards).

4) Bottom status pill (inside the combined section)
Single full-width pill with:

Very light pink background, no border, fully rounded edges.

Height ≥44px, padding ~12–14px vertical, ~16–18px horizontal.

Inline layout: heart icon + tip text.

Remove the “View All Cards” button/link entirely — only show icon and text.

Text: medium weight, muted grey; icon and text vertically centered.

5) Spacing rhythm
Heading → subtitle: ~8px gap.

Subtitle → card stack: ~12–16px gap.

Card stack → pill: ~16–24px gap.

Pill → bottom of section: ~0–8px gap (tight to section padding).

6) Final QA checklist
Only the specified three sections are updated; all other page sections remain exactly as they are now.

Combined section has a white background, unified padding, and vertical stacking.

Three cards are always visible with correct rotations, offsets, soft shadows, and pastel backgrounds.

Top card gradient, text styling, and padding match the target look.

Status pill contains only icon + text (no “View All Cards” link).
