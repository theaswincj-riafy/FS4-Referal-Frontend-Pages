Transform current card screen to target UI (HTML/CSS/GSAP only — design & structure)
A) Overall layout
Replace the current top banner module with a centered heading area: one bold title line and one lighter subtitle line stacked, both centered.

Keep content width comfortable: max 720–760px, horizontally centered with 20–24px side padding on small screens.

Use a light page background (white or very light neutral). Remove any large colored hero panels.

B) Card stack container
Show three cards simultaneously in a stacked arrangement.

Container height: ~320–340px. Place it directly under the heading area with 12–16px vertical gap.

Position all three cards centrally; each card centered horizontally in the container.

Card size: width clamp 280px → 440px (≈ 76vw on phones); height ~210–230px.

Corner radius: 24px (increase from the current smaller radius).

Shadow: soft and broad; a single shadow that feels airy (approx: medium blur, low opacity). Remove tight/dark glows.

C) Visual style of each card
Top card (primary focus)

Rotation: 0° (upright).

No blur. Highest depth.

Background: warm, subtle vertical gradient (light tan → deeper tan). Avoid saturated oranges.

Text color: white for headings and paragraph.

Text alignment: left (not centered).

Internal spacing: 20–22px top and sides.

Title: bold, 22–24px, line-height ~1.1–1.2, can break into two lines.

Body: 14–15px, line-height 1.45–1.55, max 3–5 lines; truncate or fade-out if longer.

Middle card (behind the top)

Rotation: +8°.

Vertical offset: appears 2% lower than center (slightly peeking).

Apply a very slight blur (~0.3px) to de-emphasize.

Background: soft pastel (buttery yellow or similar).

Reduce contrast of any text or keep it blank/placeholder.

Back card (farthest)

Rotation: −8°.

Vertical offset: 2% higher than center (slightly above).

Slightly stronger blur than middle (~0.6px).

Background: soft pastel (pale blue or similar).

Depth order: top > middle > back. Ensure correct stacking so overlapping edges are visible.

D) Spacing & rhythm
Gap between heading area and card stack: 12–16px.

Gap between card stack and bottom status pill: 16–24px.

Maintain generous side paddings so card shadows never clip.

E) Typography
Heading in the top area: weight 800, size 26–28px, line-height ~1.25, letter-spacing −0.02em.

Subtitle: 15–16px, lighter weight, muted gray.

Card title (on top card): weight 800.

Use consistent font across the page; avoid mixed families.

Ensure color contrast on the top card title and body is AA compliant.

F) Bottom status element (pill)
Replace any square/boxed tip panel with a single pill-shaped row.

Full-width but inset: left/right margins 20px.

Background: soft pink (very light), no border.

Border radius: 9999px.

Padding: 12–14px vertical, 16–18px horizontal.

Layout: small icon (heart) + text + a “View All Cards →” action styled as a quiet link on the same line.

Keep height ≥ 44px for tap target.

G) GSAP behavior (design-level, not code)
On initial load:

Animate the three cards in with a small fade + 0.98→1 scale.

Stagger timing so back → middle → top appears in 50–80ms steps.

Swipe interaction:

Swiping the top card moves it horizontally off-screen with 10° of tilt in the swipe direction plus a small upward lift; duration ~0.30–0.38s, ease power2.in feel.

After the top card exits, promote the middle card to become the new top (remove blur, reset rotation to 0°, center vertically).

Promote the back card to become the new middle (+8°, slight blur).

Insert a fresh back card (from API data) with −8° rotation and slightly higher vertical position and a light blur.

Keep three cards visible at all times.

Idle micro-interaction:

On press/drag start, the top card can lift by 2px (y translation) and shadow intensifies slightly, then returns on release.

H) Content binding rules (visual only)
Only the top card shows full content (title + short paragraph).

Middle/back cards do not show full content; use placeholders or reduced-opacity elements to keep the stack clean.

Enforce max lines for the top card body to prevent overflow; if exceeded, use ellipsis or gradient fade.

I) Color & theme
Page text: near-black neutral.

Muted gray for subtitles and secondary text.

Top card gradient: light warm → medium warm (no neon, no high-saturation orange).

Middle card: soft yellow; Back card: soft blue (both pale).

Single, soft shadow spec used consistently across cards; avoid multiple layered glows.

J) Responsiveness & constraints
Card width scales with viewport but never exceeds 440px and never goes below 280px.

Ensure shadows are never clipped by the container (allow extra space or overflow visible).

Maintain comfortable vertical spacing even on small screens; avoid elements touching the viewport edges.

K) Clean-up & removal
Remove any referral progress bars, redemption counters, or promo boxes from the top area.

Remove the “personalize your invite” helper panel; replace with the single bottom pill.

Remove harsh outer glows or saturated backgrounds that steal focus from the cards.

L) QA checklist (visual)
Three cards visible with clear overlap and opposing rotations.

Top card upright, left-aligned text, warm gradient, white copy.

Back/middle cards pastel, subtly blurred, and offset vertically.

Shadows are soft and consistent; corners clearly 24px.

Bottom pill present, rounded to full, with inline action link.

Swipe preserves the 3-card stack and inserts a new back card each time.

No text overflow on the top card; truncation/fade when needed.

Heading and subtitle centered; overall composition feels light and editorial.
